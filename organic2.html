        <h1>Organic farming facts</h1>
        <small></small>
        <p>organic farming, sustainable agricultural system that uses ecologically based pest controls and biological fertilizers derived largely from animal and plant wastes and nitrogen-fixing cover crops. Modern organic farming was developed as a response to the environmental harm caused by the use of chemical pesticides and synthetic fertilizers in conventional agriculture, and it has numerous ecological benefits.

        <p>Here are 10 facts about organic farming you should know
Organic Farming History – It is interesting to note that the movement supporting organic farming began seven decades back in the 1940s against the growing chemical-based farming across the world. Gradually, by the 1970s, the interest in organic farming grew in countries like the US. Today, with more awareness and demand for safe and healthy food, organic farming is growing in popularity worldwide. 
Rising Demand – According to the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture – FiBL 2020 report, there are approximately 2.8 million organic farmers in more than 180 countries. India has the most number of organic producers. As per the market research company, Ecovia Intelligence, the organic food market crossed 100 billion US dollars in 2018 for the first time. 
Organic Farming Principles
Some of the commonly followed organic farming principles and practices are discussed.
<br>
1) Health – The principle of health is integral to organic farming as it aims to protect all living organisms from soil microbes to the human population. <br>
2)Environment – Organic farming has grown in popularity due to the principle of saving the environment which includes different components such as soil, water, land, climate etc. <br>
Food Security with Responsibility – Organic farming is a sustainable method that promotes the importance of meeting food security objectives with responsibility. It includes quality food production along with increasing quantity without compromising sustainability.
<br>
Organic Farming: Benefits to the Environment<br>
3)Chemicals and Pesticides – Ever since the green revolution began, the farmers have resorted to extensive use of chemicals and pesticides to increase farm productivity. However, the prolonged use of chemicals has eliminated beneficial microbes in the soil, degrading its quality and destroying its natural characteristics.Moreover, chemical use on large has caused pollution of water bodies, making it unhealthy for human consumption. Similarly, pesticides can contaminate soil, water and air. Also, some pesticides remain for decades which is dangerous for the environment.
<br>
4)Healthy Soil – Organic farming is one of the best ways to reverse the effects of chemicals on soil. Thus organic farming practices and the use of innovations like biological seed treatment can make the soil healthy again and help the natural microbes to thrive. Consequently, it can support plant care.According to a study carried out in the US, soil in organic farms had higher soil organic matter, fulvic acid, humic acid and sequestration rate than traditional farms.
Water Health and Algal Blooms – Agricultural activities and the use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers are major sources of water pollution. The run-off from farms reaches water bodies, resulting in algal blooms. It deeply impacts the aquatic ecosystem, leading to dead zones and fish kills. Organic farming, on the other hand, eliminates all these issues. 
Crop Yield and Feeding the Population – It is predicted that food production will need to be doubled from the current rate by the year 2050. However, there is a growing demand for sustainable and eco-friendly food products from consumers. Thus, organic farming with the help of the latest technology and solutions can be the best food production model to boost crop yield and feeding the population in the future. 
<br>
5)Nutrients – Various research and studies have shown significant nutritional differences between organic farming and traditional farming crops. The concentration of different elements such as antioxidants is found to be available more in organically grown foods. Evidence shows a low presence of heavy metals as well.
<br>
Biostimulants used in agriculture can help in boosting nutrient uptake, fighting against abiotic stress and improving crop yield. Natural and eco-friendly solutions are redefining farming practises worldwide, carving out the path for sustainable agriculture.</p>
