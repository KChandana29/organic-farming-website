        <h1>Organic farming current scenario</h1>
        <small></small>
        <p>The analysis of the global organic data for the countries on the list of recipients of Official
Development Assistance (DAC List1
) shows, that one third of the world’s organic land is in
countries on this list. Most of this land is Latin America followed by Asia, Africa and Europe. The
leading countries in terms of organic land are Argentina (3.1 million hectares), China (2.3), Brazil
(0.85) and Uruguay (0.76). The highest percentages of organic land are in East Timor (6.3 %),
Uruguay (5.1 %), Mexico (2.9 %) and Argentina (2.4 %) – in these countries the shares of organic
land of all agricultural land are thus comparable to those in Europe. These countries are, however,
clearly exceptions. Out of the 80 DAC countries covered by the survey only ten have a higher share
of organic land than one percent of the agricultural area. Thus, compared to the developed
countries, organic farming in the DAC countries is lagging behind.

        <p>Clearly a strong organic movement and government support has a positive influence on
the development of the organic sector. Many countries, particularly in Latin America (Brazil,
Bolivia), are now launching action plans for organic farming, one motive being to increase
domestic food sovereignty. Another form of government support is the implementation of
government regulations in order to ease export of organic products. In Latin America more than ten
countries on the DAC list have an organic legislation, in Asia six countries and in Africa two
countries (Huber et al. 2007). More countries are in the process of drafting laws. Some countries are
now on the Third Country list according to EU regulation of organic farming (Argentina, Costa
Rica, India).
 From the data gained through the global organic survey it is clear that in many countries of
the South organic farming plays an increasingly important role. In the light of booming organic
markets (reaching 40 billion US dollars in 2006) it can be assumed that the market/export potential
for organic products continues to be high. However, to assure food security with organic products
not only in industrialised countries but also in countries in the south, more effort should be put in
developing local markets.
 In order to be able to draw clear conclusions on the potential organic farming has for food
security including supplying domestic markets more data than available so far are needed, covering
for instance information such as domestic supply with organic food, export volumes and
information on yields. There is a clear need for governments to provide better data. With more and
more countries implementing organic farming regulations data collection activities should be eased
in the future, and governments should support such activities. </p>
